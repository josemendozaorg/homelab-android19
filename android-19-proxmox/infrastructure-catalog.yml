# Infrastructure Catalog - Source of Truth for IDs and IPs
# All roles/playbooks should reference this catalog for ID and IP assignments
#
# To add a new service:
# 1. Pick an unused ID (any number not in the services list)
# 2. Assign an IP address
# 3. Add entry to this catalog with type: "container" or "vm"
# 4. Create/update role to use: catalog.services[ID]

# Services (both containers and VMs - unified to prevent ID conflicts)
