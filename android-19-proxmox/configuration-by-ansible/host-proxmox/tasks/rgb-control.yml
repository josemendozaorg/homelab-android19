# RGB/LED Light Control Tasks for Arctic Fans, CPU Cooler, and RAM
#
# This task file manages RGB lighting on the Proxmox host hardware:
# - Arctic fans
# - Arctic CPU cooler
# - RAM modules
#
# RGB control tasks will be implemented here to:
# - Install RGB control software (OpenRGB/liquidctl)
# - Detect RGB hardware components
# - Turn lights on/off based on rgb_lights_state variable
# - Configure persistence across reboots via systemd service
#
# Tasks are executed when rgb_lights_enabled is true

# Placeholder for RGB control implementation
# Implementation tasks will be added in subsequent TDD cycles
